# An unofficial implementation of Face Swapping GAN

A Pytorch implemtentation of ICCV 2019 paper [Face Swapping Gan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05932). This repository only includes the reenactment part and the other parts of FSGAN can be implemented based on this.

## Requirements:
A pretrained face recognition VGG19 model

A suitable dataset for face swapping and its face segmentation masks
